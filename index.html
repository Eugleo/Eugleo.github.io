              Genetic algorithm multiple sequence alignment, or Gamsa for short,
              is an efficient implementation of a genetic algorithm for the
              alignment of amino acid sequences. The program makes use of the
              rich Haskell type system which provides flexibility and runtime
              safety.

              Debatimer is an iOS app made for referees and debaters that debate
              under the popular Karl Popper ruleset. It sports an intuitive UX

              Those two are the only "user facing" projects in my whole
              portfolio that are being actively used. Both are relatively
              detailed and complete syntax definitions (so-called textmate
              grammars), to be used in VS Code or similar editors. Both are
              highly rated and well-received in the community.

              Markovify.jl is a Julia library that allows the user to generate
              text with characteristics similar to the texts he provides. The
              generation is based on Markov chains (hence the name) and can be
              thoroughly configured. Depending on which text files the user uses
              as the input, the library can be used to generate new words, new
              sentences or even new names of people and places. It could thus be
              of interest to prose writers or dungeon masters in Dungeons and
              Dragons.

              This project, which is one of my oldest, uses match data from ČBF
              (Czech Basketball Foundation) to show various interesting
              basketball statistics, such as the frequency and accuracy of shots
              on various positions on the field. However, as it is quite old,
              the most complicated parts are probably the web-crawling, and the
              plotting.

              Crimson is a simple 2D top-down shooter, similar in its playstyle
              to Crimsonland. It is pretty simple in terms of features, the most
              interesting bit is hidden under the hood: the whole game is built
              upon entity-component-system architecture. ECS is a type of game
              architecture that uses composition over inheritance—not dissimilar
              to the philosophy of functional languages, that I love.
