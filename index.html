									Genetic algorithm multiple sequence alignment, or Gamsa for short, is an efficient implementation of a genetic algorithm for the alignment of amino acid sequences. The program makes use of the rich Haskell type system, which provides flexibility and runtime safety.

									Debatimer is an iOS app made for referees and debaters that debate under the popular Karl Popper ruleset. It sports an intuitive UX and can be controlled without even looking at the phone. When it was on the AppStore it was one of the most popular iOS debate timers.

									Those two are the only "user facing" projects in my whole portfolio that are being actively used. Both are relatively detailed and complete syntax definitions (so-called textmate grammars), to be used in VS Code or similar editors. Both are highly rated and well-received in the community.

								</p>
								<p class="portfolio-card-content">
									Markovify.jl is a Julia library that allows the user to preload several text files and then generates random text with similar characteristics. The generation is based on Markov chains (hence the name) and can be thoroughly configured. Depending on which files the user uses as the input, the library can be used to generate new words, new sentences or even new names of people and places, thus it could be of interest to prose writers or dungeon masters in DnD.

								<p class="portfolio-card-content">
									This is one of my oldest projects which uses match data from ČBF (Czech Basketball Foundation) to show various interesting statistics, such as the frequency and accuracy of shots on various positions on the field. However, as it is quite old, the most complicated parts are probably the web-crawling, and the plotting.

								<p class="portfolio-card-content">
									Crimson is a simple 2D top-down shooter, similar in its play style to Crimsonland. It is pretty simple in terms of features, and the most interesting bit is indeed under the hood: the whole game is built upon entity-component-system architecture. ECS is a type of game architecture that uses composition over inheritance, not completely dissimilar to the philosophy of functional languages.

									This is an ongoing project that aims to provide standardized notes for all the major classes in the bioinformatics curriculum. It leverages the power of the Racket publishing system Pollen which allows us to export the same underlying content in HTML, PDF and plaintext.
